# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Dantes Nava**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Summary

**6 Press** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **Change or add to this description**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🫠👾🐸**

## Notes


In this Unit's project I have learned what specific error messages mean. For example, the last error message: NullPointerException, is a pretty infamous one for its rarity. Kotlin has null-safety features, so that makes this particular error message hard to get. One way to get this message is by using a "double-bang operator", which looks like this " !! ". It forces a non-null value. 
My favorite feature of this app is the Random Color generator. I'm a big fan of this because it feels like a game and I'd like to develop a video game on Android.
